          We cater to millions of users daily, ensuring that video content is efficiently processed and
          distributed to various platforms for both live streaming and video on demand. We also ensure that our users get the best experience by taking full ownership of the flow and resolving any issues via effective incident management.
            - **HTTP Live Streaming parser**: F# implementation of HLS parser ([RFC 8216](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8216)) for Live to VoD (Video on Demand) flow.
            - **Media RSS Feed**: Integration solution with cable companies like Ziggo and KPN to have discoverable content on user's TV set-up-boxes when they search for movie or series.
            - **Architecture Roadmap**: Together with other architects developed a vision and plan on moving towards event-driven architecture for integrations.

      - role: Technical Lead
        time: 2022 - 2023
        company: Farmtrace, Boxmeer - Netherlands
        details: |
          At [Farmtrace](https://farmtrace.com/), my responsibilities include facilitating development teams, mentoring and coaching,
          and implementing best software development practices to maintain high-quality standards. 
          Approximately 60-70% of my time is dedicated to coding, while the remainder is allocated for code
          reviews, documentation, educational sessions for developers, and business meetings.
          I actively participate in the design and development of new components and features, guiding the team
          to ensure they are equipped to handle ongoing maintenance and development independently.
          I am always ready to assist other teams that require support or advice, exemplifying my approach
          to teamwork and leadership.
            - **CI/CD**: Created Azure DevOps pipelines, Terraform modules and related setup to release software on Azure platform in a fast manner.
            - **Complex subdomain**: Re-designed and re-implemented one of the complex modules that process data from farm system (FMS) into the Azure.

      - role: Lead Developer
        time: 2020 - 2022
        company: CM, Breda - Netherlands
        details: |
          As the lead developer at [CM](https://www.cm.com/), my role involves reworking one of the core but legacy applications on our
          platform. This multi-tenant application handles the display of sent and received messages across
          all communication channels and providers, featuring advanced filtering and searching capabilities.
          The primary challenge lies in managing the vast amount of data, which includes tens of billions of
          records spanning both transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP) sources that need to be efficiently
          queried. We also face challenges in supporting a flexible security model and core features that allow
          the creation of specialized views with custom column setups. These views, which users can create
          independently, can be either private or shared. In this project, I employed a polyglot approach,
          utilizing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for modeling the application's core logic and Dapper for
          efficient generation of dynamic SQL queries for content retrieval.
          
          Additionally, I enhanced our CI/CD pipeline to create Docker images with each release, which are
          then published to a private registry and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.
            - **Product Development**: Re-designed and modernized one of the core applications on the proprietary platform. Improved security and performance. Continuously improved solutions based on direct customer feedback.
            - **Data Generator Tool**: Applied F# and built on top of FsCheck CLI tool for generating massive amount of production-like data for testing our product.

            Functional programming and domain-driven design might not seem to be a good match,
            but in fact functional programming can be an excellent approach to designing decoupled,
            reusable systems with a rich domain model.
